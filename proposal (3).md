# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive game where you play rock paper scissors plus lizard and spock against the computer.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will run in python and will be created using the random and pygame libraries. It will have a button for each possible play and the computer will respond at the same time.
There will be a score board for the player and computer. Some features that might be included are different difficulty options and a leaderboard that will be saved for future rounds.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No interactive 2d game, just an interactive game running in the code window plus a leaderboard that will save in a text file.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An interactive 2d game. This will include text, buttons, and a scoreboard.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An interactive 2d game. This will include text, buttons, a scoreboard, difficulty options, and a leaderboard saved for future rounds.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to write with pygame which could be a lengthy process. I will need to research how to create buttons, inputs, and outputs that will all appear visually.
