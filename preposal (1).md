# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?


Rock Paper Scissors with Lizard Spock from Big Bang Theory
- Players will play against the computer
- I might also save their name and wins to a leaderboard


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Can we submit a code that requires a text file along with it?
