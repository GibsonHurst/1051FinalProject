Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created an 2d interface for the player to play the game with the pygame library. I have connected visual aspects into my code to generate a responce from the computer. 
I have coded a random responce of possible answers from the computer. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not fixed all the bugs with the user interface. I have not created my intro or outro user interfaces.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had trouble removing parts of the interface. My way around this is to cover things up but that is not ideal.
